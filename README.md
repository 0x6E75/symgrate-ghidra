Howdy y'all,

This repo contains client scripts for accessing the
[Symgrate](https://symgrate.com/) databases from Ghidra to recover
symbol names, part number and I/O addresses.

The [Symgrate API](https://symgrate.com/api/) is pubicly documented,
and you are welcome to write your own clients if these scripts don't
meet your needs.
