Howdy y'all,

This repo contains client scripts for accessing the
[Symgrate](https://symgrate.com/) databases from Ghidra to recover
symbol names, part number and I/O addresses.  Import this by adding
the `src` directory to Ghidra's Script Path.

The [Symgrate API](https://symgrate.com/api/) is pubicly documented,
and you are welcome to write your own clients if these scripts don't
meet your needs.

For development, we use IntelliJ IDEA and add `ghidra.jar` to the
class path.
